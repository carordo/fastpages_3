    <p><strong>Data Analysis and Prediction of Waterpoint Functionality Using 
Spatial and Non-spatial Machine Learning Models</strong></p>

<p><strong>Georgia Tech OMSA Practicum with ESRI</strong></p>

<p>Carlos Ordonez, Rozsa Zaruba</p>

<p>December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021</p>

<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p><em>The main purpose of this project is to apply the knowledge obtained
during the Master’s in Analytics by way of using ESRI’s ArcGIS Pro
spatial software and their Python API, ArcPy. The learning process was
through a project that analyses water point data in Uganda. With ESRI’s
team guidance, we were set on a learning adventure. We learned how to
manipulate our data in ArcGIS, how to transfer the code into Jupiter
notebooks, how to think spatially, and use layers to better extract
information. We were able to see the differences (both advantages and
disadvantages) between traditional Python programming and ArcPy. At the
end, we used our knowledge to build classification models to be able to
tell if a water point is functional or not. Finally, we used ESRI’s
story map to create a presentation of our findings.</em></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Having clean and safe water, is a basic necessity that we take for
granted. Unfortunately, many rural areas in the World have no easy
access to water. Most of Uganda’s population live in rural areas and two
third of them lack easy access to safe water. Women and children spend
most of their day walking back and forth between water source and home.</p>

<p>People in many developing worlds walk an average of 3.7 miles a day for
water. Some parts in Uganda if people want to access clean water, the
only reliable borehole is about this distance one way. It can take
between 90 minutes to two hours to walk that distance. Boreholes
sometime serve more than 850 people, which makes them incredibly
crowded. You could wait two to three hours because of long lines . This
has an impact on everybody’s life: women cannot get jobs, children
cannot go to school, etc. Having water access does not guarantee that is
safe to consume, creating a health impact to society. The lack of
infrastructure and access to clean potable water in Uganda is one of the
factors slows their progress<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h1>

<p>This project analyses the water point data set for Uganda from the Water
Point Data Exchange (WPDx) using ESRI’s ArcGIS Pro and their Python API.
The project aims to find relationships in the dataset that might explain
why certain places do not have access to water, with the final goal of
finding a model that can predict the functionality of a water points.</p>

<h1 id="data">Data</h1>

of records that uniquely identify water points and provide
additional attributes such as the type and condition of the
infrastructure, functionality, service levels, etc.</p>
  </li>

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h2>

<p>Our original dataset had 121,472 observations on 52 features. The
provided dataset for Uganda contained points outside the country’s
boundaries. After removing the points outside, the total observation
remaining were 118,110. The dataset also contained many redundant
columns: e.g. “management_clean”, “management_original” and
“management”, containing the same data. We kept the ones we thought
would be most informative for our study.</p>

<p>Examining the data further, we noticed that more than 80% of the data in
the “water_tech_clean” was labeled as “NaN”. It was decided not to
impute data for this attribute in our study, because most of the
variables are categorical, and all of them have multiple levels
(management has 137 levels) and it would muddy our results. Our solution
was to remove the missing values. For “water_tech”, that would mean
reducing our data drastically. Reading up on the variables, we realized
that “NaN” is the base line for this variable, and it means that there
is no technology in place. E.g., there is a river and people would just
use their jugs to fill it up with water. Our solution was to change the
variables to “Notech” value and use it as one of the levels in the
variable.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of ArcGIS Pro, we were able to add a new categorical
variables to our dataset such as “Type_of_Region” describing if the
point observation is considered to be in an urban or rural area.</p>

<p>##</p>

<h2 id="data-exploration">Data Exploration:</h2>

<p>For the data exploration portion, we are going to answer questions as
provided in the scope of the project to try to understand more about the
data.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><u>Which district has the most non-functional water
points?</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For the project, it was determined that ”F_status_id” provides
information about the functionality of the water point. For this
question, the approach is to work with non-functional data and obtain
the districts in percentage with the largest number of non-functional
water points.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Heatmap of non-functional water points per district as
percentage of the total non-functional waterpoints, being the district
of Wakiso the largest with a total of 930 or 4.36% of the total
non-functional.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the percentage of non-functional waterpoints as a portion
of the total functional and non-functional waterpoints per districts
having the district of <em>Pakwach</em> the largest with 44.08% being
non-functional as per Figure 3.</p>

<p>Figure . Top 5 Districts with most non-functional waterpoints per
district totals</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><u>What are the top causes of non-functional water points?</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Analyzing the causes of non-functional water points the initial approach
was to understand what type of labeling the attribute “F_status” had on
each point. Table 1 shows that 90.76% has “Non-functional” label.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image4.png" style="width:4.27083in;height:2.83112in" /></p>

<p>Exploring further, it was found that out of the 18,614 non-functional
water points, there are 14,914 “Community Management” equivalents to
80.12% of total non-functionals. Furthermore 3,973 of those
non-functional charged a fee. It is possible to assume that the
community managing the water points does not have the means to be able
to support the infrastructure necessary to treat them, and the
Government cannot reach those communities in order to provide a service
in which they could charge. Also, it is possible that the poverty level
of those communities does not allow them to pay for water service.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><u>Which year saw the most water point installations?</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Doing a bar plot analysis as per Figure 4 it was found that 2007 was the
year with the highest water point installations. There is a clear
increase after 1986, which makes sense if we consider the country’s
history. Uganda had a Civil War between 1980 till 1986. People started
going back to their homes, there was need for more water, and the
country tried to recover from the war.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image5.png" style="width:1.8125in;height:1.59193in" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><u>Which water points serve the largest rural population? Repeat
the analysis for urban population. Do these water points have
anything in common?</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Using spatial filtering techniques with “Uganda_UrbanAreas_Africopolis”
as the filter, a new attribute was created to determine rural and urban
water points. Then with the layer “Uganda_Pop2016_points_clipped<strong>”</strong> a
boundary of 1km was established outside the urban areas. We established
a large population by finding the mean of the population, that was
established at 436 per population point as shown on Figure 5. Figure 17
in the Appendix shows the distribution of the population and the mean.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image7.JPG" style="width:2.59205in;height:2.35417in" /></p>

<p>Figure . Waterpoints serving the largest urban and rural populations</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><u>Is there a relation between age of water point and the water
point being Non-functional?</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When we are looking at the summary of the data for functional and
non-functional water points based on the installation year, we get a
false sense that in recent installation years we have more broken
points. In reality, there are more water points installed recently than
in the past. We divided up the data into two intervals: water points
installed before 1985 we consider old, everything after is new. Based on
the histogram 1985 looked like a natural break, new point installations
picking up after. As we mentioned above, this aligns with the country’s
history too.</p>

<p>We calculated the percentage of non-functional water points for the old
and new installations. We found that 27.6% of the old water points were
non-functional, while “only” 18.5% of the new wells were broken. To
answer the question, yes the older the water point it is more likely
that it may be broken.</p>

</ul>

<p>After aggregating the points by districts for the largest water points
of the rural areas, the district of Ntungamo shows the largest number of
points. The graph shows the values in percentages. Ntungamo is the green
district in the south of the country in Figure 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><u>Is there an association between water source, water tech,
facility type or management for Non-Functional water points?</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Using aggregate numbers for each of these variables can be misleading.
For example, boreholes have the greatest number of non-functioning water
points. But most of the water points are boreholes. We decided to use
percentages again to see the relationships better. Our Findings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, 20.85 % of the “undefined shallow wells are broken. The
number of “protected shallow wells” and “piped water” are much
smaller to fairly compare to the boreholes, but it is still alarming
that 23% of them is broken</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>23% of the hand pumps are broken</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 17% of the water points is broken if the facility type is
improved. It jumps up to 29% for unknown or 24% if there is no
facility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private operators have only 7% of broken water points. Community
management and Other Institutional Management are doing fairly with
19% and 25% broken points. All the other managements do poorly
maintaining the water points, school management being the worst with
81% of broken water points.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to look at association between variables is to look at the
correlation matrix as per Figure 9. The correlation matrix does not show
high correlations. To see how significant the relationships are we did a
chi-square analysis with the following null and alternative hypothesis:</p>

<p><strong>H_0:</strong> There is no association between pairwise variable.</p>

<p><strong>H_Alt</strong>: There is significant association.</p>

<p>Our p-values are very large, which tells us that we cannot reject the
null hypothesis, there is no significant association between variables.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image11.png" style="width:5in;height:3.41667in" /></p>

<p>Figure Correlation matrix of selected attributes</p>

<p>We have to note that the correlation matrix and chi-square analysis both
assume linear relationship. Our conclusion thus is that there is no
linear association between variables, we need to find models that handle
non-linear relationships (like Random Forest) and avoid the ones that
assume linear relationships (like Logistic Regression).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><u>What percent of the population does not have easy access to
working water points?</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This question was answered entirely using ArcPy and ArcGIS Pro. We
created 1 km buffers and counted all the points that fall outside of it
as shown in Figure 10. The total number of population outside of a 1km
radius of functional water points is 7,010,728. This is equivalent to
almost 20% of Uganda’s population (for the year of 2016).</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image12.jpg" style="width:4.73958in;height:2.57715in" /></p>

border</p>

<h2 id="geoenrichment-and-imputation">GeoEnrichment and Imputation</h2>

<p>Our results in the previous sections did not show a clear relationship
between variables. To improve our dataset, we decided to enrich the
data. We connected with the online ArcGIS tool to enrich the data for
every district. One of the challenges that we encountered is that the
enriched data had fewer districts than the one in our dataset. This
created a series of null values in several districts. To overcome this,
we impute information based on the location of the district. This was
accomplished by finding the districts in the vicinity of the missing
district and taking the average of the enriched parameters. Figure 11
shows in darker colors the districts that had no enrichment information
and the districts that were used for imputation around them in a lighter
color.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image13.png" style="width:2.74316in;height:2.76042in" /></p>

<p>Figure Districts in dark have requires impute with neighbor districts in
lighter color</p>

<p>The <em>KeyFacts</em> in the GeoEnrichment library contained potentially
valuable information for the country and the districts. Some of the
available variables were unemployment, population density, number of
males, number of females, etc.</p>

<p>The enriched data showed promising attributes, but many of them were

<h2 id="feature-extraction">Feature Extraction</h2>

<p>As we saw above, it is hard to find a meaningful explanation between
variables. It does not mean that there is none, it only means that there
is no linear association. Clustering would find points that are similar
to each other, so it is a good method for feature extraction. We explore
a couple of techniques and save results as features for our
classification analysis.</p>

<p>Our non-spatial clustering method is KModes clustering. It is one of the
unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms that is used to cluster
categorical variables (with categorical variables we cannot calculate
the distance as we would do with Kmeans algorithm). This method uses the
dissimilarities (total mismatches) between the data points. The lesser
the dissimilarities the more similar our data points are. It uses modes
instead of means.</p>

<p>The KModes images show points with similarities. To the naked eye it is
difficult to assess what similarities they have. Our intent with this
clustering technique is to use it for modeling as features (variable in
the dataset is Cluster_KModes).</p>

<p>Figure KModes spatial representation</p>

<p>We explored three different spatial clustering techniques such as:
<strong>Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with
Noise (HDBSCAN), Ordering Points To Identify Cluster Structure
(OPTICS),</strong> and <strong>Spatial Constrained Multivariate Clustering</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>HDBSCAN</em></strong> is a powerful algorithm that uses Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), converting it into a
hierarchical clustering algorithm, and then using a technique to extract
a flat clustering-base in the stability of clusters. Densities are
estimated based on core distances and form the density landscape. Using
a global threshold to set the sea level at, DBSCAN identifies the
“islands“ (DBSCAN). Then HDBSCAN helps decide: are these several
“islands” or one “island” with multiple peaks? Figure 13 shows a
representation of HDBSCAN clusters and the output was saved as a feature
for modeling. The gray color represent noise. Figure 19 shows cluster
allocation.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image15.JPG" style="width:2.71875in;height:2.75794in" /></p>

<p>Figure Clustering using HDBSCAN</p>

<p><strong><em>OPTICS</em></strong> is a technique that has two principles: Core Distance and
Reachability Distance. Core Distance is defined as the minimum value of
radius required to classify a given point as a core point. If the given
point is not a Core point, then its Core Distance is undefined. The
Reachability Distance: is defined with respect to another data point.
This clustering technique is different from other clustering techniques
as it does not explicitly segment the data into clusters. Instead, it
produces a visualization of Reachability distances and uses this
visualization to cluster the data. The resulting clusters are visualized
in Figure 14. The blue cluster represents the large allocation of a
cluster. Figure 20 shows the cluster allocation. Figure 21 shows the
reachability plot. After further examination we noticed that HDBSCAN and
OPTICS have a 99.5% correlation. For our future analysis we decided not
to use the OPTICS results as it would not add extra information to our
models.</p>

<h2 id="dimensionality-reduction">Dimensionality Reduction</h2>

<p>Dimensionality reduction helps compress the data with less noise. We can
use the reduced data for our modeling. Two methods were explored:
Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Autoencoder Neural Network.</p>

<p><strong><em>Correspondence Analysis (CA)</em></strong> is a Dimensionality Reduction
technique that is traditionally applied to contingency tables. It
transforms data in a comparable manner as Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), where the central result is a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
CA needs the data to be in contingency tables which means it is more
appropriate to apply it to categorical features. <strong><em>Multiple
Correspondence Analysis (MCA)</em></strong> is an extension of the CA for more than
two categorical features (three or more). We have more than two
categorical features, hence the use of MCA. We ran MCA on our data
reducing the features to the first 2 components.</p>

<p><strong><em>Autoencoder</em></strong> is an unsupervised artificial neural network that
compresses the data to lower dimensions and then reconstructs the input
back. Autoencoder finds the representation of the data in a lower
dimension (middle layer) by focusing more on the important features
getting rid of noise and redundancy. We are going to use this middle,
compressed layer as features in our modeling.</p>

<p><strong>Data used for modeling:</strong></p>

<p>For most of our analysis, we used the reduced enriched dataset with
clustering information. We also explored a dataset with only the MCA
components and clustering information, another with only autoencoder
features and clustering information. For more details see Appendix.</p>

<h1 id="proposed-methodology-for-analysis">Proposed Methodology for Analysis</h1>

<p>The main question that we would like to answer is: Can we predict the
status of a water point (working or non-working)? This is a
classification problem. Classification usually refers to any kind of
problem where a specific type of class label is the result to be
predicted from the given input field of data.</p>

<h2 id="we-approached-the-problem-in-two-ways-through-spatial-analysis-and-non-spatial-analysis-for-non-spatial-analysis-knn-naïve-bayes-nb-svm-random-forest-are-used-from-pythons-scikit-learn-library-for-spatial-analysis-we-use-random-forest-classifier-from-arcpy-package">We approached the problem in two ways: Through spatial analysis and non-spatial analysis. For non-spatial analysis, <em>KNN, Naïve Bayes (NB), SVM, Random Forest</em> are used from Python’s scikit-learn library. For spatial analysis, we use <em>Random Forest Classifier</em> from ArcPy package.</h2>

<p>To have a base reference we are running a dummy classifier (only
identifies majority class labels), but we are also using Naive Bayes as
a baseline. It does not make sense to do a logistic regression as the
data exploration did not suggest a linear relationship. Our main focus
is going to be on K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Random Forest models.</p>

<p><strong><u>*Naïve Bayes* (NB</u>)</strong> classifier is a probabilistic classifier
based on Bayes’ theorem, which assumes that each feature makes an
independent and equal contribution to the target class. NB classifier
assumes that each feature is <em>independent</em> and does not interact with
each other, such that each feature independently and equally contributes
to the probability of a sample belonging to a specific class.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN</u>)</em></strong> is a supervised and pattern
classification learning algorithm that helps find which class the new
input belongs to when <em>k</em> nearest neighbors are chosen and distance is
calculated between them. It attempts to estimate the conditional
distribution of Y given X, and classify a given observation to the class
with the highest estimated probability. We found the optimal number of
neighbors using the elbow method. Each model for each dataset was tuned
individually and the number of k that minimized error rate was chosen
for each model as shown in Figure 18.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>Support vector machine (SVM</u>)</em></strong> is a linear model for
classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and
non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea
of SVM is simple: the algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which
separates the data into classes. For our data this may not be the best
solution as this method cannot create nonlinear separations.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>Random Forest</u></em></strong> is a classification algorithm consisting of
many decisions trees. It uses bagging and feature randomness when
building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of
trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any
individual tree. We are using grid search to find the optimal setup for
each dataset. The decision metric for the grid search is ‘ROC-AUC’.</p>

<h2 id="metrics-used-for-evaluation">Metrics Used for Evaluation</h2>

<p><strong><u>Confusion Matrix</u></strong> is a performance measurement of the
classification.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_3/assets/images/2022-03-13-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Waterpoint-Functionality-Using-Spatial-and-Non-spatial-Machine-Learning-Models/media/image18.png" style="width:2.23338in;height:1.26012in" /></p>

<p>Figure Confusion Matrix Illustration</p>

<p><strong><u>The Kappa Coefficient:</u></strong> Cohen’s Kappa is defined as (Observed
Accuracy - Expected Accuracy) / (1 - Expected Accuracy). It evaluates
how well the classification performs compared to chance, in which all
values are just randomly assigned. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1
and a value greater than 0 indicates that the classification is
significantly better than random. This metric was used between
non-spatial models.</p>

<p><strong><u>Precision</u></strong> — Measures what percent of your predictions were
correct. Precision can be defined as the ability of a classifier not to
label an instance positive that is actually negative. For each class, it
is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of a true positive
and false positive.</p>

<p><strong><u>Recall</u></strong> — Measures what percent of the positive cases did you
catch. Recall is the ability of a classifier to find all positive
instances. For each class it is defined as the ratio of true positives
to the sum of true positives and false negatives.</p>

<p><strong><u>F1 score</u></strong> — Measures what percent of positive predictions were
correct. The F1 score is a weighted harmonic mean of Precision and
Recall such that the best score is 1.0 and the worst is 0.0. F1 scores
are lower than accuracy measures as they embed Precision and Recall into
their computation. As a rule of thumb, the weighted average of F1 should
be used to compare classifier models, not global accuracy.</p>

<p><strong><u>AUC (Area Under the ROC curve)</u></strong> — Represents the degree or
measure of separability. It tells how much the model can distinguish
between classes. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at
predicting classes correctly. AUC is scale-invariant: it measures how
well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values. Also,
AUC is classification-threshold-invariant: It measures the quality of
the model’s predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is
chosen.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-unbalanced-data">Dealing With Unbalanced Data</h2>

<p>Before starting the modeling, we examined the data for class
distribution, and we noticed that the two classes are heavily
unbalanced: only 19% of the data belongs to the minority class
(non-functional water points). The challenge of working with imbalanced
datasets is that most machine learning techniques will ignore, and in
turn have poor performance on, the minority class, although typically it
is performance on the minority class that is most important. Some of the
classical solutions would be to use methods that train on the majority
class and identify minority classes as an anomaly. Two methods were
tried in our study:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>One-Class SVM:</em></strong> When modeling one class, the algorithm captures
the density of the majority class and classifies examples on the
extremes of the density function as outliers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Isolation Forest</em></strong> is a tree-based anomaly detection algorithm.
It is based on modeling the normal data in such a way to isolate
anomalies that are both few in number and different in the feature
space. Tree structures are created to isolate anomalies: isolated
examples have a relatively short depth in the trees, whereas normal
data is less isolated and has a greater depth in the trees.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Having unbalanced data made us consider different over and
under-sampling techniques too. We are creating data sets with
over-sampling, under-sampling and over-and-under sampling at the same
time. We kept a separate testing set and only over/under-sample the
training data. We train the models on this data and use the separate
testing data for testing.</p>

<h2 id="oversampling-techniques">Oversampling Techniques</h2>

<p>One approach to addressing imbalanced datasets is to oversample the
minority class. The simplest approach involves duplicating examples in
the minority class, although these examples do not add any new
information to the model. We call this <strong><em>traditional oversampling</em></strong>.</p>

<h5 id="synthetic-minority-oversampling-technique-smote-synthesizes-new-examples-from-the-existing-examples-there-are-variations-of-this-approach"><strong>Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)</strong> synthesizes new examples from the existing examples. There are variations of this approach:</h5>

  <li>
    <h5 id="smote-works-by-selecting-examples-that-are-close-in-the-feature-space-drawing-a-line-between-the-examples-in-the-feature-space-and-drawing-a-new-sample-at-a-point-along-that-line-specifically-a-random-example-from-the-minority-class-is-first-chosen-then-k-of-the-nearest-neighbors-for-that-example-is-found-typically-k5-a-randomly-selected-neighbor-is-chosen-and-a-synthetic-example-is-created-at-a-randomly-selected-point-between-the-two-examples-in-feature-space"><strong><em>SMOTE</em></strong> works by selecting examples that are close in the feature space, drawing a line between the examples in the feature space, and drawing a new sample at a point along that line. Specifically, a random example from the minority class is first chosen. Then <em>k</em> of the nearest neighbors for that example is found (typically <em>k=5</em>). A randomly selected neighbor is chosen, and a synthetic example is created at a randomly selected point between the two examples in feature space.</h5>

Also, the technique attempts to select regions where there are fewer examples of the minority class and tries to extrapolate towards the class boundary.</h5>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="under-sampling-methods">Under-sampling Methods</h3>

<p>Under-sampling is a technique to balance uneven datasets by keeping all
of the data in the minority class and decreasing the size of the
majority class. We tried the following variations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>NearMiss-1:</em></strong> Selects only those majority class examples that
have a minimum distance to three minority class instances, defined
by the n_neighbors argument.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Tomek Links:</em></strong> If the examples in the minority class are held
constant, the procedure can be used to find all of those examples in
the majority class that are closest to the minority class, then
removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Edited Nearest Neighbors Rule for Undersampling:</em></strong> This rule
involves using k=3 nearest neighbors to locate those examples in a
dataset that are misclassified and that are then removed before a
k=1 classification rule is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>One-Sided Selection for Undersampling:</em></strong> It is an undersampling
technique that combines Tomek Links and the Condensed Nearest
Neighbor (CNN) Rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Neighborhood Cleaning Rule for Undersampling:</em></strong> It combines both
the Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN) Rule to remove redundant
examples and the Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) Rule to remove noisy
or ambiguous examples. It focuses less on improving the balance of
the class distribution and more on the quality (unambiguity) of the
examples that are retained in the majority class.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="random-over-and-under-sampling">Random Over-and-under Sampling</h3>

<p>These techniques use both over and undersampling together to create the
training dataset. First, they are oversampled and undersampled right
after. Variations that we used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Random over than undersampling</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>SMOTE-TOMEK</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbors</em></strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="analysis-and-results">Analysis and Results</h1>

<h2 id="summary-of-non-spatial-results">Summary of Non-Spatial Results</h2>

<p>We ran many models with different data sets and are comparing the best
of them. More detailed outputs can be found in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Our <strong><em>dummy classifier</em></strong> (a classifier that only finds the majority
label) has an average accuracy of 81%. This is already a sign why not
trust this metric since we already know that it does not capture any of
the minority cases. The AUC curve is 0.5, the Cohen Kappa is 0, telling
us that this is not a useful model.</p>

<p>Our other base model is the <strong><em>Naïve Bayes</em></strong>: the best model we found
was for the sample that was SMOTE oversampled and Nearest Neighbor
undersampled at the same time. AUC curve improved to 0.58, Cohen Kappa
0.103 which suggests that the model is somewhat useful. We also look at
the precision and Recall numbers, especially we are interested in the
minority class. With a higher Recall but low Precision, our classifier
considers that more points are non-functional than they are.</p>

<p><strong><em>Support Vector Machine:</em></strong> We were getting some promising Precision
results (see Table 4), but the Recalls were very much close to 0. If we
did not care about false negatives, and we only focused on true
positives and false positives this high Precision result may even be
good. But this is another question because we do not have a cost
analysis to associate to the model. Which one costs more? Going out to
repair a wrongly classified working well, or not going out to a
non-working well? Models need high Recall when we need output-sensitive
predictions and we need to cover false negatives as well. If it is okay
to flag working wells as not working but a non-working wells should not
be flagged as working then we would need a high Recall. The F-1, Cohen
Kappa and AUC on the other hand suggested that this model is not good.</p>

<p>Adding the cluster information to our base enriched data did not improve
significantly our models. Same for using MCA and Autoencoder Neural
Network reduced datasets. One-class classification methods did not seem
to work better either. We started seeing some changes with over/under
sampling techniques. We used the enriched dataset with cluster
information to create new samples on the training data. We ran most of
the models (except for the one-class models) and saw that the AUC moved
above 0.60, the precision and Recalls are closer to each other. We chose
the traditional oversample results (Table 5) to be able to compare it
with the spatial analysis and because it got slightly better results.
The rest of the sampling methods created synthetic data and we cannot
create coordinate data with them to be able to use it in spatial
analysis.</p>

<p>The two most promising models were the K-Nearest Neighbor and Random
Forest classifier. Both models performed well on almost all of the data
samples. For the traditional oversample data both had an AUC above 0.65
(67% and 69% respectively), with the highest Precision on the minority
class of 66% achieved with Random Forest. Again, it was interesting to
see, that if we were to choose a model based on average accuracy, Naïve
Bayes would have been chosen. We can see that all the other metrics
suggest that NB model is not that good.</p>

<p><strong>Random Forest</strong> was the most stable model for most of the data, so we
are reporting all of the results in Table 6. It is interesting to note
that with the neighborhood type under-sampling methods, we were able to
create models that had high AUC, and at the same time high Recalls on
the minority class (0.79). Again, if our goal is to not miss any of the
non-working points (our false negatives to be as low as possible) and we
don’t care that some of them are actually working water points, we can
use these models. We have to be careful using the F1 as the metric for
comparing the models as it gives equal weight to Recall and Precision.
If we know that one or the other is more important in our analysis, we
can use a weighted version of the metric that gives different weights
for the two metrics.</p>

<h2 id="spatial-analysis-results">Spatial Analysis Results</h2>

<p>In spatial modeling we used <strong>Forest-based Classification and
Regression</strong> on different datasets with 100 trees. Adding clustering
data did not seem to improve the models. Model 1 and Model 2 show very
similar results. Model 3 and 4 use only the clustering features and MCAs
respectively. They perform well for functional water points but
underperform for non-functional ones. For Model 5 and 6 we are using
additional layers with over and undersampling. Using explanatory
training distance features improves the performance of non-functional
water points. The best performer is Model 6 with adding the
<strong>Ug_Wetlands-extent-and-types1996</strong> layer extracted from Africa
Geoportal hosted by Esri<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> , followed really closely by model 5 with
the <strong>Uganda_UrbanAreas_Africapolis</strong> layer provided with the initial
package. Both layers can be seen in Figure 23 . These models had the
highest AUC and Precision.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the best two models (5 and 6) use two
types of techniques to manage the imbalanced data, yet they arrive at
very similar results. Model 5 uses oversampling and Model 6 uses
undersampling. Figure 24 shows a map of the results of Model 6. In blue
correctly classified points and in orange misclassified points. Figure
25 shows the prediction performance plot for Model 6. Figure 26 shows
the prediction performance table for Model5. Table 7 provides a summary
of the results for each model for spatial modeling.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<h2 id="comparison-between-spatial-and-non-spatial-data">Comparison Between Spatial and Non-Spatial Data</h2>

<p>After testing different models using enriched data set with ArcGIS Pro’s
Random Forest (spatial models) and scikit-learn (non-spatial models), we
were able to obtain slightly better results with non-spatial models.
This may be because we have more knowledge and tools to tune the
non-spatial models. For example, we were able to implement the SMOTE
method and other synthetic sampling methods to deal with the unbalanced
data.</p>

<p>Working with imbalanced data, we considered the F1, Recall, and
Precision scores to be a more accurate representation of the performance
of the models. When choosing our model, we are considering higher
numbers on the minority labels mentioned above.</p>

<p>Regarding spatial models, we chose Model 6 because it had the best F1,
Precision, Recall and AUC on the minority class. Model 5 had very close
results with slightly better metrics on the majority class.</p>

<p>In comparison, for the non-spatial models KNN and Random Forest
performed best. Random Forest seemed to handle the task slightly better
at every sampling method.</p>

<p>We noticed that the spatial analysis produced more consistent results
regardless of the sampling method. Non-spatial analysis showed different
results based on the sampling method as we mentioned above. If our
objective is to have higher Recall, we would suggest Nearest Neighbor
Undersampling methods to achieve it. Also, we have to note, that if our
goal is high Precision, we would suggest the SVM model. Table 8 shows
the summary of the best spatial and non-spatial models.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>Throughout the analysis, we focused on how to predict if a water point
is working or not working. Our models for the minority did not perform
as desired in predicting them and it made us think that it is almost
random which water point is broken and which one is not. As we mentioned
at the beginning, for the water technology column, the baseline is “no
technology”, and more than 80% of the data had no pump, no kiosk etc. In
our dataset only 154 observations were on piped water. The majority was
a borehole (36,571), protected spring (27,660), undefined shallow well
(18,177) rainwater harvesting (16,620). Assuming that people have access
to these water sources, what guarantees that the water is safe to drink?
It is a vicious cycle: People cannot afford safe water so they walk
hours to get water that might not be potable. The socio-economic impact
is dramatic. Because they spend their time going after water, they
cannot be employed. Also, they are more likely to get sick from the
unhealthy conditions, which would keep them away from work, put a strain
on the medical system etc. The real solution would be affordable water
through infrastructure, where the quality of the water could be
controlled. Strategically build water points within easy reach for
everyone.</p>

<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h1>

<h2 id="arcpy-and-arcgis-pro-versus-regular-python">ArcPy and ArcGIS Pro Versus Regular Python:</h2>

<p>The main purpose of this project was not only to do data analysis but
also to learn how to work with ArcGIS Pro and use ArcPy. We used manly
the ArcGIS Pro for both spatial and non-spatial analysis. Our Jupiter
notebooks were created inside ArcGIS Pro, we never left this
environment. It was easy to see that without the capabilities of ArcGIS
Pro we would have missed crucial information. For example, it would have
been impossible to distinguish and find the points outside the country’s
boundaries. There were many calculations that were at the tip of our
fingertip using ArcPy functions, while in regular Python it took several
steps and modifications to get the same results. One of the questions we
were only able to answer using only ArcPy (creating buffers to be able
to calculate how many people were outside easy reach of water as Figure
22). We found the ArcGIS Pro’s GUI was easy and fast to work with, but
some calculations when transferred into the notebook using ArcPy took
considerable time to run. The under and oversampling was done
automatically in ArcGIS while on regular Python we had to create new
datasets and then use them in the models. We found that our training
from our graduate studies helped a lot in tuning our non-spatial models.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-that-we-overcame">Challenges That We Overcame:</h2>

<p>Our first challenge was to quickly understand how to think spatially,
how we can use layers on top of each other to extract information. Once
learned, we found that some of tasks became very natural and easy. The
way we overcome this first challenge was to rewatch lectures, read about
the topic and mostly talk it through with each other. It helped a lot
when we were coding and debugging together through shared screens.</p>

<p>The rest of the challenges were mostly technical and not about what we
needed to do, but how to do it right. For example, improving our data,
through enrichment, took considerable time and effort to get the results
that we were happy with. It required imputing data to districts with
missing data. Also, the enrichment data was district data, we needed
point data for within each district. ArcGIS Pro was a big help doing
these tasks.</p>

<p>For modeling, we did not want to run every model we were ever thought,
but rather use the ones that make sense based on our data exploration
and questions (e.g. It would not make sense to run a regression on a
classification problem).</p>
