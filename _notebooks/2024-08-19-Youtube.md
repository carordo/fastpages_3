# Video to Text Conversion

In this transcript, Nicholas Ronatt presents a method to convert video to text. The process includes the following topics:

## Downloading YouTube Videos

By using the YouTube DL library, virtually any YouTube video can be downloaded. The initial step in this process is to download desired YouTube content via the YouTube DL library.

## Pre-process Video to Audio

Once the video is retrieved, the next step involves pre-processing video to audio with the help of the FFmpeg library, which facilitates the extraction of audio from any video.

## Converting Audio to Text

After successfully extracting the audio from the video, this audio information is then transformed into text using the Watson Speaker Tech Service.

## Outputting Converted Text

Finally, the resulting text gleaned from the audio extraction and conversion is output into a text file, providing a complete transcript that can be used further without additional modification.

Throughout this process, the primary workspace is a Jupyter notebook. The workflow includes:

  1. Extracting audio from downloaded video using YouTube DL functionality.
  2. Converting audio to text using the Watson Speech to Tech Service.
  3. Creating a .txt file to output the converted text using native Python functionality.

The core steps in Python consist of installing and importing dependencies, extracting audio using FFmpeg, creating a speech to text service, converting it to text, and outputting it to a .txt file. Additionally, one more step is implemented to grab a video.

# Using the Youtube-dl Library

The youtube-dl library is an excellent tool for downloading YouTube videos, which can then be used to convert videos or grab notes. 

## Installation

To install the library, open up a new terminal and type in `pip install youtube-dl`. Python is necessary to use the `pip install` command. Once installed, type in `youtube-dl` and the link to the YouTube video you wish to download. The video will download in the home directory.

## Using the Downloaded Video

After downloading the video, it can be moved to the same directory as your Jupyter notebook. For ease of use, the video file name can be changed, for example to `aiml.mkv`.

# Getting Started: Installing Dependencies 

To start processing the video, we need to install specific dependencies.

## IBM Watson Services

The IBM Watson Services is a needed dependency for processing downloaded video files.

## FFmpeg Library

FFmpeg is a crucial library for video and audio file handling. This library is specifically used to extract audio from video files to be used in the Watson Speech to Text service.

# Jupyter Notebook Setup

This section covers the installation of necessary dependencies within a Jupyter notebook.

## Installing Dependencies 

To run Jupyter notebook, use the `pip install ibm watson` command to install necessary dependencies. If `ffmpeg` needs to be installed, type `brew install ffmpeg` for a Mac. For a Windows system, follow the additional steps through the link provided later.

# Importing Dependencies

The next step after installation is importing the dependencies. This tutorial utilized `ibm watson` dependencies and `subprocess` for audio extraction.

## Imported Libraries 

The libraries imported for this tutorial include;
- `subprocess`: This allows us to make a subprocess call using our regular terminal.
- `speech to text` class from `ibm watson`: Used to connect to the speech-to-text service.
- Helpers e.g., `recognize_callback` and `audio_source`: Also imported from `ibm watson`.
- `iam authenticator`: This is used to authenticate against the speech-to-text service.

# Audio Extraction

The process of extracting audio from a video as preparation for speech-to-text conversion is conducted in the next section of the transcript.

## Using ffmpeg for Audio Extraction

Extracting the audio is achieved by passing the command through the `ffmpeg` library.

# Extracting Audio from Video
Through specifying the file name, bitrate, and frequency, we can extract audio from any file. This is achieved by using the subprocess library and shell commands in programming. The result is an audio file (for example, 'audio.wav') extracted from a video file.

# Setting up Watson Speech to Text Service
## Setting Up Steps
The Watson Speech to Text Service can be used for free, capable of converting up to 500 minutes of speech to text per month. To set this up, users will need an API key and a URL. 

## Acquiring API Key and URL
These can be obtained by visiting the website 'cloud.ibm.com/catalog'. From there, users should select 'services', then 'AI and machine learning', and finally 'speech to text'. This will display various pricing plans. 

## Getting Started
Choosing the light plan offers 500 free minutes per month, which is sufficient for beginners. After selecting 'create', the service will be created and users can access their API key and URL to be utilized in their own notebooks. After a service is created, it can be managed directly from the website.

# API Key and URL Setup
Firstly, the API key and URL has to be grabbed by hitting the manage option. Afterwards, store the API key in the respective variable.

# Speech to Text Service Setup
## Creation of IAM Authenticator
A new IAM authenticator was created using the API key obtained from the IBM cloud service.

## Creation of new Speech to Text Service
A new Speech to Text service was then created, which utilised the authenticator created above. Additionally, the service URL was set as per our preference.

## Locating the Service on WWW
The purpose of establishing the service URL was to indicate the location of our service inside the World Wide Web.

# Audio Conversion 
## Conversion Method
The Speech to Text service convert audio files into text using its '.recognize' method. We pass through the audio file and the conversion takes place as per the configurations set.

## Pre-processing and Results
Once the conversion process steps are completed, the pre-processing of the results happens which is then exported to a '.txt' file.

## Code Review
The conversion code opens the designated audio file and uses the recognitze function to convert it into text passing through a series of commands and settings. The audio for the file is specified according to the requirements.

# Audio Processing and Text Conversion

## Sending Audio File

The transcript begins discussing sending a .wav audio file for processing using a given language model from the Watson speech to tech service. This process is indicated by a continuous flag and results in stored processed data.

```markdown
## Running the Process
The process runs and returns a converted text transcript of the audio, which is stored in a variable named 'res'. The processing time can vary, with an 8-minute video, for instance, taking a few minutes to complete.
```

## Outputting Processed Text

### Viewing Results
These converted results can be viewed by entering 'res', which displays the converted audio.

### Manipulating Results
If further pre-processing is needed, or if the transcript should be exported to an external text file, it's possible to loop through each transcription.

```markdown
#### Result Keys
There are two keys present in the results - 'result index' and 'results'. These contain different parts of the returned data.

#### Extracting Results
The 'results' key contains transcriptions broken out into paragraphs. These paragraphs can be looped through individually for extraction or to output to a text file.
```

# Video Transcription Process

## Pre-processing Results
The process begins by pre-processing the results of a result array and storing them in another array. Some additional pre-processing is done before the results are pushed out to a text file. 

## Transcription and Text File Creation
This process results in a large array of the transcription data. The successive steps involve reviewing the transcriptions, expected to be in the form of eight paragraphs. Subsequent steps involve cleaning up the transcripts. This involves stripping out any whitespace and concatenating the paragraphs into one continuous block of text. This cleaned up block of text is then pushed out to a `output.txt` file. 

## Post-Processing and Final Output
The post-processing part of this process involves titling. The first letter of each sentence in the text block is titled - making the entire block appear clean and easy to read. The sentences are then joined together to obtain a single large text block. The entire transcript, now devoid of multiple paragraphs, is written out to a text file. 

## Recap of Process Steps
1. **Video Downloading:** The first step involved downloading a video from youtube using the `youtube_dl` library. 
2. **Dependency Importation & Audio Extraction:** Following which the necessary dependencies were imported. The audio from the downloaded video was then extracted using `ffmpeg`.
3. **Setting Up Speech to Text Service & Conversion:** A speech to text service was then set up with the audio converted from video to speech. 
4. **Outputting the Speech:** The final step involved outputting the speech to a text file. 

The result of these steps is a detailed video transcript.
