**How To Build A Dashboard For Crypto Currencies With Macros In Google Sheets**

If you have entered into crypto world, you may have noticed that it is
difficult to know what is your exact crypto balance, particularly if you
move your crypto out of the exchanges.

What I have read is the importance to manage wallets independently from
the exchanges. Not all wallets work for al crypto currencies, and you
may be buying from different exchanges. Therefore, it is sometimes
difficult to know what is your balance as the crypto may be spread
between exchanges and wallets.

Additionally, having an understanding of the value market cap of the
different currencies and the circulating supply may give an intuition of
the value of the crypto currency.

To accommodate both, the portfolio balance and the market capitalization
comparison, I have put together this simple Google Sheet based on the
dashboard from this post [How to monitor your Crypto Portfolio using
Google
Sheets.](https://pedrogomes.medium.com/how-to-monitor-your-crypto-portfolio-using-google-sheets-f52161d503ff)

The dashboard is meant to provide a single place to track balances based
on current prices and give some understanding of the different market
caps, from flagged/selected crypto currencies. A toggle column **OnOff**
is used to select a specific crypto currency. A column for circulating
supply and the percentage of circulating supply of the total selected
coins, provides an idea of what is the total value of the selected
crypto.

Crypto prices are populated from the [Crypto Prices
API](https://cryptoprices.cc/), which provides a simple way to update
your dashboard almost a real time.

The API allows to obtain current crypto price by parsing the symbol of
the crypto currency.

**IMPORTDATA("https://cryptoprices.cc/BTC/")**

Other data can be called is market capitalization

**IMPORTDATA("https://cryptoprices.cc/BTC/MCAP")**

Also, all time high.

**IMPORTDATA("https://cryptoprices.cc/BTC/ATH")**

The **Refresh** button updates the information on the top right, updates
the prices of crypto currency.

In the **Portfolio** tab with blue letters enter the information of the
symbol, date, value, cost and fees of each crypto transaction. A total
net gain or loss is reflected on the most right.

## Market Capitalization and Circulating Supply

The tab Market_info, contains information to give an insight of the
market from a selected number of coins.

**On_Off:** On(1) Off(0) column is used to select the particular crypto
currency, If marked 0 no info is shown.

**Symbol**: Used for the crypto currency.

**Price**: Current market price from Data Source

**Marketcap**: Market capitalization from Data Source

**AllTimeHigh**: Provides crypto currency all time high

**Circulating Supply:** Calculated by dividing the market cap by the
current price.

**Percentage of Circulating Supply from Total Coins:** This column
calculated the percentage of the circulating supply based on the
selected columns.

The Refresh button to the right is macro that executes the update for
the **Price**, **Marketcap** and **AllTimeHigh** columns. This
[link](https://spreadsheet.dev/buttons-in-google-sheets#:~:text=To%20assign%20a%20macro%20to,by%20clicking%20on%20the%20button.)
has instructions to help set it up.

The bar plots to the right provides info on the circulating supply vs
the market cap, and the percentage of the circulating supply from the
selected currencies.

It is important to note that, SHIB and DOGE â€“ particularly SHIB-
circulating supply is so large, that it shadows all the other symbols
when looking at the percentage of the circulating supply from the total
selected coins.
