To create a md file use this code for GitHub:

pandoc --extract-media=. -s 2022-01-16-Financial_Analysis-Excel_Basics.docx -t gfm -o mddoc.md

After you press Enter, you’ll find you have a new file (name.md) containing your blog in markdown format, and a new folder called “media” containing a folder with the name of your doc.

Open the markdown file in an editor or word processor, and do a search and replace (- in Microsoft Word), searching for “name/media”, and replace with “/images/name” (be careful to type the forward slash characters exactly as you see them). The lines containing your images should now look like this:
