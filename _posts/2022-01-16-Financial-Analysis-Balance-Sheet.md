# Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements

There are two types of cash flow statements:

-   Accounting cash flow statements

    -   Reconciles the change in the cash account

    -   Uses income statement and balance sheets

-   Financial cash flow

    -   Separates the financing decision form the investment decision

    -   Cash flow FROM assets

        -   Investment decision

    -   Cash flow TO bond/debt holders and stock/equity holders

        -   Financing decision

-   Cash is king when we want to get the value or the price of something

## Income Statement

Follow the accrual method of accounting, income and expenses are
recorded in the period that they occurred not in the period cash was
received or paid. Remember that income statement does not record the
purchase of a fix asset, it records the depreciation expenses, related
to the useful life of the asset.

## Balance Sheet

It is considered a stock statement. A snapshot of what we have. It is
organized in terms of liquidity. Accumulated depreciation is a running
total of the individual years worth of depreciation. It is a counter
account in the assets column. Liabilities are listed in order of
maturity. Accrued expenses, examples is salaries, not paid yet.

Equities:

-   Preferred stock

-   Common stock

    -   Common stock ( $1 par value) - external equity

    -   Capital surplus – external equity -also known as additional paid
        in capital. Money paid by investors in excess of par value. If
        stock sold a $20 but par value at $1 then register $19
        difference here.

-   Accumulated retained earning

    -   Not paid in dividends

-   Less Treasury stock

    -   Counter account , for example when the company re-purchases
        stock. Buy back stock

## Statement of Cash Flows

-   Example of Flow statement. It shows the sources and uses of cash
    used by a firm

> Impact on cash base on this table:

-   If assets increases cash goes down

-   I assets decrease cash goes up

-   If liabilities or equity increase cash goes up

-   If liabilities or equity decrease cash goes down

-   The Total CF from operating activities include net income,
    depreciation expenses, increase in deferred taxes and the Operating
    section.

-   For the finance section. Dividends = Net Income – Change in Retained
    Earnings

-   The Proceeds from stock issuance = Change in Common stock + Change
    Capital surplus. This account shows the stock sold.

-   Purchase of stock = Change in less treasury stock / buy back stock

-   The sum of total for operating, investing and financing, has to be
    equal to the change of cash between year in the balance sheet.

If net new borrowing was negative, that will be an inflow to the
creditors, the “-“ sign takes care is it is an inflow or an outflow
